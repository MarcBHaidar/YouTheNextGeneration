                <!-- <h1>FOUNDER</h1> -->
                <p><span>Rita Samaha</span><br> an artist, model, and dancer from Beirut. Since 2017, she’s been working in the the art scene and fashion industry partnering with international brands . Each project is a catalyst for inspiration and influence. Her work, rooted in diverse experiences and intensive training, aims to empower Arab women through art. Explore her website to witness my journey, and if intrigued, feel free to reach out. Welcome to her  realm where art fuels purpose and each creative endeavor paves the way for positive change.</p>    
                <p style="padding-top: 0;">Coming from the Middle East, it was hard to reach any goal or achieve any dream, as she was alone navigating this challenging industry. The scene lacked any community of empowerment or support for young arab women looking to shine in the field. She had to knock on doors alone, face challenges and obstacles. This is why she decided to create this platform, to raise the voice of arab talents and potentials, share opportunities, show them the  road and walk it with them. You is a community of support, where you can meet people that paved the way in the industry, people that found keys and the knowledge on the road ready to give them to you so you open your own doors.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 0;font-weight: bold;">Here, nothing is unreachable, it is only YOU, the Unreachable Star.</p>
